    - My goal is to create products that truly make a difference to users. I want to have a positive impact, even if it’s something small like making someone’s grocery shopping slightly easier.
    - I love learning new things and my biggest strength is the speed at which I’m able to do so. My education has given me a base to leap forward from and I'm excited to do just that.
    - Born and raised in Gothenburg, I’ve graduated from Chalmers University of Technology with a Msc. in Software Engineering. My education has given me a broad range of skills, from data science & AI to UI/UX and everything in between.
